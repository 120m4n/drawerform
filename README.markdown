What is DrawerForm?
===================
DrawerForm is just a sample project showing how to implement a Facebook-style UI for your Delphi XE4 iOS applications. By Facebook-style, I mean where the main content area slides over to the right exposing a Drawer of content on the left. This can be triggered either by the "Hamburger" button in the toolbar, or by swiping left/right on the toolbar.
